# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett-Hackard need us to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

- The employee and title files were joined to make a table consisting of the employee names, employee numbers, titles, and the dates for which they worked for the company. The list was also filtered to include employees born between 1952 and 1955. The result was nearly approximately 134,000 employees but there were duplicate entries for some employees.

-  This list was further refined to ensure no repeated entries. Once filtered out, it was determined that the number of potential retirees is 72,458. 

- Here is the approximate breakdown of retiring staff by title:

- To determine mentorship eligibility, a table was constructed using the employee names, employee numbers, dates of birth, and the dates for which they worked for the company. The list was filtered only to include employees born in the year 1965. Through this, it was determined that 1,499 current employees met the criteria to become mentors.

## Summary: 
About 72,000 roles will need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact.

Only 1,499 employees are eligible to become mentors.

 Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Pewlett Hackard has enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department to mentor the next generation.
